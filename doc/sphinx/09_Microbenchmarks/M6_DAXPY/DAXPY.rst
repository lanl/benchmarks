Purpose
=======

Daxpy is a loose acronym that stands for "Double (precision) ax plus y".

The daxpy benchmark is a simple program used to test and measure the performance of basic linear algebra operations on a computer system. It implements the operation y += ax where a is a scalar, and x and y are vectors. The daxpy benchmark provides a simple, standardized way to test the low-level computational performance of different computer systems for a basic but essential linear algebra operation. It serves as a baseline indicator of speed for more complex programs.

The benchmark is small and simple enough that the performance is dominated by computation speed and memory access. The daxpy operation is broadly representative of operations common in scientific and engineering applications.
