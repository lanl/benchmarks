IOR START

### You MUST change the following parameters (see README.XROADS)
    numTasks=240            # number of MPI processes to use.  You may choose to use one or more MPI processes per node.
    segmentCount=1048576    # must be > fileSize / ( blockSize * numTasks ) where fileSize must be greater than 1.5 times the aggregate DRAM available for use by the page cache
    memoryPerNode=80%       # must be > 80% of the node's DRAM available for use by the page cache

### You MAY change the following parameters
    testFile=datafile.dat   # will read/write files called ./datafile.dat.00000000 ./datafile.dat.00000001 etc
    keepFile=0              # do not delete files used by the test at the end of each execution

### You MUST NOT change the following parameters
    transferSize=4K         # size of a single data buffer to be transferred by a single I/O call
    blockSize=4K            # must be the same as transferSize
    reorderTasksConstant=1  # each node n writes data; that data is then read by node n+1
    intraTestBarriers=1     # use barriers between open/read/write/close
    repetitions=1           # executes the same test multiple times
    verbose=2               # print additional information about the job geometry
    fsync=1                 # for POSIX api call fsync(2) before close(2)

### The following parameters define the nature of the benchmark test
    api=POSIX               # use POSIX open/close/read/write
    filePerProc=1           # read/write one file per MPI process
    randomOffset=1          # randomize order in which reads/writes occur
    writeFile=1             # perform the write component of the test
    readFile=1              # perform the read component of the test after the write component has completed

RUN

IOR STOP
