# 
# Description : This script is used to set the affinity between an MPI
#               process and the GPU on the system.
#
#               The processes rank on a node is normally used to do this
#               and different MPI launchers expose this information through
#               different environment variables. For example, MVAPICH2 uses
#               MV2_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK and OpenMPI uses
#               OMPI_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK. For other MPI libraries, please
#               set the LOCAL_RANK variable below to the appropriate one.

export LOCAL_RANK=$MV2_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK
exec $*
